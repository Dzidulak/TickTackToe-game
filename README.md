# TickTackToe - C++
 
There are 3 differnt versions of the game.
Each version is played in the terminal where the user will input the number over the posion on the grid.

Version 1 is a Coop game where 2 human players play each other. 

Version 2 is a human player vs the computer. The comnputer is operates using a random number generator to determine the position on the playing board.

Version 3 is also human vs computer however the computer is using some AI. 
I used the minimax algorithm for the computer to choose the best possible postion of the grid.
